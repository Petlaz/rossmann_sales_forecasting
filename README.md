Rossmann Sales Forecasting is a machine learning project that predicts daily sales for over 1,100 Rossmann drug stores across Europe. Leveraging historical sales data, promotions, holidays, and store-specific features, the project applies feature engineering and advanced regression models to deliver accurate forecasts with real business value.

Key Features

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts daily sales using historical patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates meaningful temporal and promotional features
- **Multiple Model Evaluation**: Tests various regression approaches
- **Production-Ready**: Includes Gradio web interface for easy predictions
- **Interpretable Results**: Provides feature importance and error analysis
