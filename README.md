Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting is a time series machine learning project that predicts daily sales for over 1,000 Rossmann drug stores using historical sales data, promotions, holidays, and store-specific features. The project leverages advanced regression models and feature engineering, and includes an interactive Gradio app for real-time sales prediction.
